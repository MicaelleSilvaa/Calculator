# Calculator

Simple calculator in python, we start with a function that stores the options menu, then we have functions to store each simple operation.
In short, basically all the code is based on functions, either functions to store operations or values typed in by the user.
In this calculator, the user is able to perform basic two-number operations via the menu where they choose what they want to do.
